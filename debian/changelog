  * Module m_nispasswd added by Utz-Uwe Haus <haus@uuhaus.de>.
  * Added variable MAIL_DOMAIN_NAME to override other settings of mail
    domain.
  * Change Build-Dependency to debhelper >=2.0.103, which is needed for
    dh_installlogrotate (Closes: #94471).
  * Replace dh_testversion by versioned build-depends.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.5.2 (no changes).
  * Depend on mawk | awk to give apt a default.

lbdb (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new module m_bbdb to access a (X)Emacs big brother database (bbdb)
    from lbdb using (x)emacs as the backend.  Thanks to Utz-Uwe Haus
    <haus@uuhaus.de> for providing this.
  * s/MODULE_PATH/MODULES_PATH/ in documentation to match the behavior of
    the program (Closes: #83933).
  * m_gpg: stop using --with-colons, because this outputs utf8 instead of
    your local charset, which causes problems with non 7bit characters
    (Closes: #83936).
  * Add a new variable KEEP_DUPES, which allows to see duplicate mail
    addresses (with different real names or comment fields) (Closes: #83908).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Feb 2001 17:57:54 +0100

lbdb (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a second grep to m_pgp5 and m_gpg to remove UIDs, which don't
    match the search string, but are only generated, because a different
    UID of this key matches.
  * Add new module m_gnomecard based on an idea by Rick Frankel
    <rick@rickster.com>.
  * Always use /bin/sh as the shell on Debian systems, because Debian
    guarantees, that /bin/sh is a posix shell (Closes: #75475).
  * Move /usr/share/doc/lbdb/override.Lintian to
    /usr/share/lintian/overrides/lbdb.
  * Add $(install_prefix) to Makefile.in and change debian/rules to use
    it.  Thanks to Rob Payne <rnspayne@adelphia.net> for providing the
    idea and a patch.
  * Update lbdb.spec.in, patch provided by Rob Payne
    <rnspayne@adelphia.net>.
  * Remove dh_suidregister from debian/rules.
  * Update Debian package description.
  * Upgrade lbdb.el to version 1.9 (Thanks Dave!).

lbdb (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new module m_addr_email to request data from addressbook program
    (http://red.roses.de/~clemens/addressbook/) by Torsten Jerzembeck
    <toje@nightingale.ms.sub.org>.
  * Some optimizations on m_addr_email to handle city name correct and to
    junk entries without email address.
  * Update lbdb.el to version 1.8:
    - Fixes the problem with spaces in query strings (Closes: #74818).
    - New commands lbdb-region and lbdb-maybe-region to query lbdb for the
      content of the current region.
    - Autoload lbdb-region and lbdb-maybe-region from startup file.
  * Use sort without -u option, because duplicates are already removed by
    munge before.
  * Do not overwrite m_inmail.list on munging, if file system is full.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Oct 2000 17:59:07 +0200

lbdb (0.21.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update lbdb.el to version 1.4 to avoid problems with status line of
    lbdbq.
  * Correct behavior of variable SORT_OUTPUT (did the inverse of what it
    should do).
  * Correct output of number of matching entries (count after munging
    instead before).
  * SORT_OUTPUT now can be "name" or "address" to sort output by mail
     real names or addresses (still the default).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Oct 2000 12:05:28 +0200

lbdb (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't fail in m_palm, if no database is available.
  * Update lbdb.el to version 1.3 (thanks Dave).
  * m_muttalias: Add support for "alias foo <foo@bar> (Foo Bar)" style
    aliases.
  * Correct typo in m_muttalias, which stopped to work when your HOME is
    your MUTT_DIRECTORY (Closes: #71975).
  * Correct README (we have more than two modules now :-)
  * Create sysconfdir, if it doesn't already exist.
  * lbdbq: write information about number of matching entries into status
    line and exit with return value 1, if no matching entries were found.
  * Correct exit value of lbdbq (trap command).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Oct 2000 01:12:33 +0200

lbdb (0.20.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix name conflicts (m_palm_lsaddr now completely renamed to
    palm_lsaddr).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Aug 2000 04:14:05 +0200

lbdb (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add emacs interface lbdb.el 1.2 by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org> and
    install it on Debian systems.
  * Add m_palm module and palm_lsaddr by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>.
  * Update package description in debian/control file.
  * Update documentation.
  * Add override.Lintian to avoid warnings about missing Palm::PDB and
    Palm::Address, which are in libpalm-perl, that is suggested (we don't
    depend on it, because this is only used by the m_palm module).
  * Rename $p to $CURRENT_MODULE_DIR in lbdbq, so a module can access the
    directory where it is placed itself for accessing some helper
    applications.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Aug 2000 15:46:02 +0200

lbdb (0.19.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove erroneous quotes from lbdb-fetchaddr, which caused fetchaddr to
    write "`' wrong parameter" error message to procmail log file.
  * Correct the getopt behavior in lbdb-fetchaddr.
  * s/strfcpy/strncpy/ in fetchaddr.c.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Aug 2000 13:45:47 +0200

lbdb (0.19.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed option -h to -x, because -h is already used for "help".

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Aug 2000 19:04:07 +0200

lbdb (0.19.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a new option -h to lbdb-fetchaddr and fetchaddr, which allows you
    to add a colon separated list of header fields to search for mail
    addresses.  If this option isn't given, we fall back to
    "from:to:cc:resent-from:resent-to" (Closes: #54169).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Aug 2000 19:46:27 +0200

lbdb (0.19.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version of m_pine by Gabor Fleischer <flocsy@mtesz.hu>: Now
    handles aliases without real names correct (by using a single space as
    the realname, so Mutt has not problem with this.
  * Add new helper program qpto8bit, which converts quoted-printable
    (according to RFC2047) to plain 8bit (without MIME header).  This is
    used by m_pine to decode quoted-printable in addressbooks to 8bit.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.2.0:
    - Evaluate DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for -g and strip.
  * Upgrade to new debhepler:
    - Change to DH_COMPAT=2.
    - Add some dh_* calls to debian/rules.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Aug 2000 21:20:59 +0200

lbdb (0.19.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "-f" option from configure @AWK@ variable and manually add it,
    where it is needed, otherwise @AWK@ cannot be used for inline scripts.
  * Add new module m_pine, provided by Gabor FLEISCHER <flocsy@mtesz.hu>
    to search pine address books.
  * Fixed m_muttalias to additionally accept "foo@bar (Foo Bar)" style
    addresses and to ignore group aliases.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Jun 2000 12:09:32 +0200

lbdb (0.19.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make dotlock.c compile on systems without snprintf() again.
  * Don't remove Makefile in clean target but only in distclean.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun, 28 May 2000 11:32:16 +0200

lbdb (0.19.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new module m_muttalias, provided by Brian Salter-Duke
    <b_duke@lacebark.ntu.edu.au> to search mutt alias files for aliases.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 27 May 2000 14:47:17 +0200

lbdb (0.19.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Give the dateformat to fetchaddr(1) using the -d option (instead of
    simply using argv[1]).
  * Give the dateformat to lbdb-fetchaddr(1) using the -d option.  If
    there is only one parameter, this is used as dateformat for backward
    compatibility.  Manpage adapted to this.
  * Remove DOTLOCK=/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock from ./configure environment.
    This is superfluous since --enable-lbdb-dotlock is used, but it
    doesn't cause problems (neither with mutt installed or deinstalled)
    (Closes: #64134).
  * Fixed typo in m_abook ("@$" instead of "$@").

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 22 May 2000 10:59:59 +0200

lbdb (0.19.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct dependencies:
    - No longer depend on mutt (only suggest it), we use lbdb_dotlock now,
      so #58188 is really closed now.
    - Depend on awk instead of mawk, because we use /usr/bin/awk, which
      can be any awk.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 10 May 2000 03:16:05 +0200

lbdb (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to standards version 3.1.1: Add Build-Depends.
  * Hardcode finger and mutt_dotlock in debian/rules, to avoid additional
    Build-Depends.
  * use safe_strdup() instead of strdup() which isn't available on Ultrix.
  * Add lbdb.spec by Horms <horms@vergenet.net>.
  * Update the version number in lbdb.spec via configure.
  * Add abook support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
    <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
  * Add NIS support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
    <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
  * Add --enable-lbdb-dotlock to configure options to force using of
    lbdb_dotlock (instead of using mutt_dotlock) and use this option for
    the Debian package (Closes: #58188).
  * Update FSF address in copyrights.
  * Update dotlock code from mutt 1.1.12.
  * Use /usr/bin/awk instead of /usr/bin/mawk in the Debian package
    (/usr/bin/awk is handled by alternates mechanism to point to the
    "optimal" awk replacement).
  * Speed up munge (nearly two times as fast as previous version).
  * Add option SORT_OUTPUT to lbdb.rc, which can be set to "false" or
    "no".  This implies that lbdbq doesn't sort the output but reverts its
    order, so the most recent addresses from m_inmail.list will be shown
    first.  Thanks to Andrew Over <aover@uq.net.au> for this idea.

    is available (don't do anything in m_finger, if finger isn't
    available).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Nov 1999 02:51:52 +0100

lbdb (0.18.4) unstable; urgency=low

lbdb (0.18.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HP-UX support (by David Ellement <ellement@sdd.hp.com>):
    - Try awk (in addition to mawk, gawk, nawk).
    - Don't use "if ! ..." in shell scripts, because ksh in HP-UX doesn't
      support this.
  * Make dotlock.c more portable.
  * Make Makefile.in much more portable.
  * Merge in changes of dotlock program from Mutt 0.96.6.
  * Upgraded Debian standards version to 3.0.1:
    - GPL now in /usr/share/common-licenses/
    - /usr/man -> /usr/share/man
  * Add -v and -h options to lbdbq and lbdb-fetchaddr which display the
    version of lbdb and a short help.

lbdb (0.18.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always build Debian binary with m_pgp2, m_pgp5 and m_gpg (ignoring
    whether the different PGP binaries are installed).
  * Merged in changes from Mutt's dotlock (CVS as of 1999-08-01).
  * Use "$@" instead of $1 in m_* files to allow `lbdb First Last' without
    quotes around "First Last" (Closes: #42417).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Aug 1999 00:44:58 +0200

lbdb (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Splited lbdb-fetchaddr.man off from lbdbq.man.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Jun 1999 18:22:53 +0200

lbdb (0.17.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded autoconf from 2.12 to 2.13.
    Get rid of `echo $PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"` in AC_PATH_PROC() macro,
    because this isn't needed and doesn't work with autoconf 2.13.
  * Removed word boundary check in m_inmail, because this is only
    available in GNU grep.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 25 May 1999 15:53:53 +0200

lbdb (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Delay munging of mails when using lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail by adding a
    new script lbdb-munge, which is run by lbdbq and can be run by cron
    additionally. Thanks to Enrico Zini <zinie@cs.unibo.it> for the base
    idea of this.
  * Made lbdb-fetchaddr Y2K compliant by changing the date format which is
    written to the 3rd column of m_inmail.list to "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" (e.g.
    "1999-04-29 14:33").
  * Made date format in lbdb-fetchaddr runtime configurable as a command
    line parameter. If no date format is specified, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" is
    used as the default.
  * include getopt.h only if it is existing (using autoconf).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 12:22:13 +0200

lbdb (0.16.2) unstable; urgency=low

lbdb (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dotlock command from mutt 0.96.1 sources (without the SGID mail
    stuff) which is installed as lbdb_dotlock, when no mutt_dotlock can be
    found. This doesn't change the Debian binary, because the Debian
    package depends on mutt which is compiled with mutt_dotlock in the
    Debian environment (because of "SGID mail")

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Apr 1999 19:24:26 +0200

    - m_pgp5:   scans your PGP 5.* keyring for addresses
    - m_gpg:    scans your GnuPG keyring for addresses
  * Made config directory autoconf configureable as @sysconfdir@ (this
    does not change anything for the Debian package).
  * Fixed trouble in configure.in noted by Fabrice Noilhan
    <noilhan@clipper.ens.fr>.

lbdb (0.13) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded lbdb.sl supplied by Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>
  * Moved lbdb.sl to /usr/doc/lbdb/examples
  * Removed dependency to mutt-i (>= 0.94.10), because there was no mutt-i
    >= 0.94.10, instead mutt-i was renamed to mutt in the time of adding
    the needed mutt_dotlock.
  * Create ~/.lbdb/m_inmail.list in lbdb-fetchaddr if it does not exist.
  * Fix manpage lbdb-fetchaddr(1) to refer to the correct db filename.
