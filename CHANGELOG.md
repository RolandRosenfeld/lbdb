  the program (https://bugs.debian.org/83933).

  junk entries without email address.

  munge before.
- Do not overwrite m_inmail.list on munging, if file system is full.

## [0.21.1] - 2000-10-09

- Correct output of number of matching entries (count after munging
  instead before).

## [0.21] - 2000-10-08

### Added

- Update lbdb.el to version 1.3 (thanks Dave).
- m_muttalias: Add support for "alias foo <foo@bar> (Foo Bar)" style
  aliases.

### Fixed

- Don't fail in m_palm, if no database is available.
- Correct typo in m_muttalias, which stopped to work when your HOME is
  your MUTT_DIRECTORY (https://bugs.debian.org/71975).
- Correct README (we have more than two modules now :-)
- Create sysconfdir, if it doesn't already exist.
- lbdbq: write information about number of matching entries into status
  line and exit with return value 1, if no matching entries were found.
- Correct exit value of lbdbq (trap command).

## [0.20.1] - 2000-08-24

### Fixed

- Fix name conflicts (m_palm_lsaddr now completely renamed to
  palm_lsaddr).

## [0.20] - 2000-08-21

### Added

- Add emacs interface lbdb.el 1.2 by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>
- Add m_palm module and palm_lsaddr by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>.

### Fixed

- Update documentation.
- Rename $p to $CURRENT_MODULE_DIR in lbdbq, so a module can access the
  directory where it is placed itself for accessing some helper
  applications.

## [0.19.9] - 2000-08-16

### Fixed

- Remove erroneous quotes from lbdb-fetchaddr, which caused fetchaddr to
  write "`' wrong parameter" error message to procmail log file.
- Correct the getopt behavior in lbdb-fetchaddr.
- s/strfcpy/strncpy/ in fetchaddr.c.

## [0.19.8] - 2000-08-08

### Fixed

- Renamed option -h to -x, because -h is already used for "help".

## [0.19.7] - 2000-08-07

### Added

- Add a new option -h to lbdb-fetchaddr and fetchaddr, which allows you
  to add a colon separated list of header fields to search for mail
  addresses.  If this option isn't given, we fall back to
  "from:to:cc:resent-from:resent-to" (https://bugs.debian.org/54169).

## [0.19.6] - 2000-08-05

### Added

- New version of m_pine by Gabor Fleischer <flocsy@mtesz.hu>: Now
  handles aliases without real names correct (by using a single space as
  the realname, so Mutt has not problem with this.
- Add new helper program qpto8bit, which converts quoted-printable
  (according to RFC2047) to plain 8bit (without MIME header).  This is
  used by m_pine to decode quoted-printable in addressbooks to 8bit.

## [0.19.5] - 2000-06-23

### Added

- Add new module m_pine, provided by Gabor FLEISCHER <flocsy@mtesz.hu>
  to search pine address books.

### Fixed

- Remove "-f" option from configure @AWK@ variable and manually add it,
  where it is needed, otherwise @AWK@ cannot be used for inline scripts.
- Fixed m_muttalias to additionally accept "foo@bar (Foo Bar)" style
  addresses and to ignore group aliases.

## [0.19.4] - 2000-05-28

### Fixed

- Make dotlock.c compile on systems without snprintf() again.
- Don't remove Makefile in clean target but only in distclean.

## [0.19.3] - 2000-05-27

### Added

- Add new module m_muttalias, provided by Brian Salter-Duke
  <b_duke@lacebark.ntu.edu.au> to search mutt alias files for aliases.

## [0.19.2] - 2000-05-22

### Changed

- Give the dateformat to fetchaddr(1) using the -d option (instead of
  simply using argv[1]).
- Give the dateformat to lbdb-fetchaddr(1) using the -d option.  If
  there is only one parameter, this is used as dateformat for backward
  compatibility.  Manpage adapted to this.

### Fixed

- Remove DOTLOCK=/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock from ./configure environment.
  This is superfluous since --enable-lbdb-dotlock is used, but it
  doesn't cause problems (neither with mutt installed or deinstalled)
  (https://bugs.debian.org/64134).
- Fixed typo in m_abook ("@$" instead of "$@").

## [0.19] - 2000-05-08

### Added

- Add abook support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
  <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
- Add NIS support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
  <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
- Add lbdb.spec by Horms <horms@vergenet.net>.
- Update the version number in lbdb.spec via configure.
- Add option SORT_OUTPUT to lbdb.rc, which can be set to "false" or
  "no".  This implies that lbdbq doesn't sort the output but reverts its
  order, so the most recent addresses from m_inmail.list will be shown
  first.  Thanks to Andrew Over <aover@uq.net.au> for this idea.

### Fixed

- use safe_strdup() instead of strdup() which isn't available on Ultrix.
- Add --enable-lbdb-dotlock to configure options to force using of
  lbdb_dotlock (instead of using mutt_dotlock) and use this option for
  the Debian package (https://bugs.debian.org/58188).
- Update FSF address in copyrights.
- Update dotlock code from mutt 1.1.12.
- Speed up munge (nearly two times as fast as previous version).

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in lbdb-fetchaddr.man.
- Fixed typo on lbdbq.man (https://bugs.debian.org/48143).

## [0.18.3] - 1999-09-18

### Fixed

- m_gpg no longer writes error messages to stderr, when the given search
  string does not exist (https://bugs.debian.org/45422).

## [0.18.2] - 1999-09-15

### Added

- Added HP-UX support (by David Ellement <ellement@sdd.hp.com>):
  - Try awk (in addition to mawk, gawk, nawk).
  - Don't use "if ! ..." in shell scripts, because ksh in HP-UX doesn't
    support this.
- Add -v and -h options to lbdbq and lbdb-fetchaddr which display the
  version of lbdb and a short help.

### Fixed

- Make dotlock.c more portable.
- Make Makefile.in much more portable.
- Merge in changes of dotlock program from Mutt 0.96.6.

## [0.18.1] - 1999-08-04

### Security

- Merged in changes from Mutt's dotlock (CVS as of 1999-08-01).

### Fixed

- Use "$@" instead of $1 in m_* files to allow `lbdb First Last' without
  quotes around "First Last" (https://bugs.debian.org/42417).

## [0.18] - 1999-06-23

### Added

- Added Fido module m_fido and nodelist2lbdb.

### Changed

- Splited lbdb-fetchaddr.man off from lbdbq.man.
- Moved lbdb-fetchaddr from $bindir to $libdir.

## [0.17.1] - 1999-05-25

### Fixed

- Upgraded autoconf from 2.12 to 2.13.
  Get rid of `echo $PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"` in AC_PATH_PROC() macro,
  because this isn't needed and doesn't work with autoconf 2.13.
- Removed word boundary check in m_inmail, because this is only
  available in GNU grep.

## [0.17] - 1999-04-07

### Added

- Delay munging of mails when using lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail by adding a
  new script lbdb-munge, which is run by lbdbq and can be run by cron
  additionally. Thanks to Enrico Zini <zinie@cs.unibo.it> for the base
  idea of this.

### Changed

- Made lbdb-fetchaddr Y2K compliant by changing the date format which is
  written to the 3rd column of m_inmail.list to "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" (e.g.
  "1999-04-29 14:33").
- Made date format in lbdb-fetchaddr runtime configurable as a command
  line parameter. If no date format is specified, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" is
  used as the default.

### Fixed

- include getopt.h only if it is existing (using autoconf).

## [0.16.2] - 1999-04-06

### Fixed

- Removed some bash, GNU-make, and GNU libc specials.

## [0.16.1] - 1999-04-05

  stuff) which is installed as lbdb_dotlock, when no mutt_dotlock can be
  found.

## [0.15.1] - 1999-02-21

### Added

- m_passwd: give UID in comment field.

### Fixed

- m_gpg: now only return addresses which match
  query. https://bugs.debian.org/33672.

## [0.15] - 1999-02-18

### Added

- Added new modules:
  - m_passwd: looks into /etc/passwd for addresses
  - m_pgp2:   scans your PGP 2.* keyring for addresses
  - m_pgp5:   scans your PGP 5.* keyring for addresses
  - m_gpg:    scans your GnuPG keyring for addresses

### Fixed

- Made config directory autoconf configureable as @sysconfdir@

## [0.14] - 1999-01-16

### Fixed
