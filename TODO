- fetchaddr: Find out why fetchaddr sometimes runs forever on Solaris 2.6.

- Add man page for configuration file lbdbrc(5) or something like
  this.

- Think about a debug/log mechanism for lbdbq and the modules, so an
  error in a module doesn't imply lbdbq to fail but all other modules
  work as usual and the error messages (and debug informations) are
  written to the logfile (maybe ~/.lbdb/debug).

- replace m_passwd and m_yppasswd by m_getent, if getent(1) is
  supported by all UNIXes.  Otherwise we need some autoconf magic to
  do the right thing...

- Optimize munge/munge-keeporder to work case-insensitive (at least on
  the domain part of the addresses).

- Add testsuite.

- Run shellcheck on all sh scripts and fix warnings.

- Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS nodoc (using debhelper >= 10.6)

- Write tests for lbdb-fetchaddr / m_inmail.
